**Hanoi's** autumn carries with it the enchanting allure of young green rice, locally known as _com_. This delicate and fragrant treat is inseparably linked to the city's fall season. It's a culinary gem that finds its place in the heart of the city, reminiscent of both the artistic expressions of poets and musicians.

Street vendors selling young green rice can be found all over the city's streets. **Vong** and **Me Tri** villages are two renowned hubs for crafting this rustic treat. Made from early-harvested young rice and prepared with meticulous care, this delicacy is tender, subtly sweet like milk, wrapped in _dong_ (phryniumplacentarium) and lotus leaves, and tied with rice straw. _Com_ can be enjoyed plain or transformed into sticky rice, sweet soup, or stir-fried dishes.

In the past, **Hanoians** paired green rice with ripe bananas and hot tea, while today's youth favor the combination of green rice with egg coffee, a novel yet delightful culinary pairing.
